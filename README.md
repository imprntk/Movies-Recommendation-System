Movies recommended System

Developed a personalized movie recommendation system to suggest movies based on user preferences using Python and machine learning techniques. The system processes and cleans large datasets, including movie details, cast, crew, genres, and keywords, to create a rich feature set.

Utilized Cosine Similarity with CountVectorizer for feature extraction to compute movie similarities based on textual data, including movie descriptions, genres, keywords, cast, and director information. This model generates movie recommendations based on content similarity, ensuring accurate and relevant suggestions.

Key highlights:

Data Cleaning: Processed and transformed raw movie data, extracting and standardizing features such as genres, keywords, top cast members, and directors.

Feature Engineering: Combined multiple textual features (overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew) into a single unified feature set for effective similarity calculation.

Recommendation Engine: Leveraged Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between movies, providing personalized and relevant movie recommendations based on user input.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Cosine Similarity, Jupyter Notebook.
